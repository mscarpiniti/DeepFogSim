# DeepFogSim
DeepFogSim is a MATLAB-supported software toolbox aiming at testing the performance of virtualized technological platforms for the real-time distributed execution of the inference phase of CDNNs with early exits under IoT realms. 

In a nutshell, the main peculiar features of the proposed DeepFogSim toolbox are that: (i) it allows the joint dynamic energy-aware optimization of the Fog-hosted computing-networking resources under hard constraints on the tolerated inference delays; (ii) it allows the repeatable and customizable simulation of the resulting energy-delay performance of the overall Fog execution platform; (iii) it allows the dynamic tracking of the performed resource allocation under time-varying operating conditions and/or failure events; (iv) it is equipped with an user-friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI) that supports a number of graphic formats for data rendering.

In order to launch the VirtFogSim simulator with the standard command-line interface, please run the file:

otherwise, to launch the VirtFogSim simulator with the Graphical User Interface (GUI), please run the file:
