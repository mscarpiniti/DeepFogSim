# DeepFogSim
DeepFogSim is a MATLAB-supported software toolbox that allows the dynamic joint optimization and tracking of the energy and delay performance of Mobile-Fog-Cloud systems for the execution of Conditional Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) over a settable network topology.

In order to launch the VirtFogSim simulator with the standard command-line interface, please run the file:

> DeepFogSim

otherwise, to launch the VirtFogSim simulator with the Graphical User Interface (GUI), please run the file:

> DeepFogSimGUI
